        period specified by law. For those not specified by law, we will retain the information
        according to the shortest storage period required for business. For data that exceeds the
        storage period, or data that you request us to delete, we will delete said data accordingly
        or take other appropriate measures without violating the relevant laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p> 2. How we protect your personal information</p>
      <p>
        We will take other necessary measures to protect the security of your personal information
        and prevent data from being misused, unauthorized access, and unauthorized modification,
        disclosure or destruction, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We implement security safeguards designed to protect your personal information and regularly
        monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use administrative,
        technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information by taking the types
        of the personal information, the processing, and the threats posed themselves into account.
        We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to keep your personal data secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, we need to remind you that no matter how perfect the measures are, there is no
        absolute guarantee of avoiding the occurrence of data storage security incidents. If a data
        breach event occurs, we will report it to the corresponding regulatory authorities as
        required by the relevant laws and regulations, and provide the type of personal data
        involved in the breach, the number of data subjects, the possible consequences of the
        breach, and the remedial measures we intend to take according to the requirements of the
        regulatory authorities. We will take the best possible measures to remedy or mitigate the
        damage and consequences of data breach. When permitted or required by laws and regulations,
        we will inform you of the possible consequences or significant damage to you in a timely
        manner, so that you can take appropriate measures promptly to protect your rights as much as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no absolutely safe website, Internet transmission, computer system and wireless
        connections. In addition to the necessary protective measures we have taken, users have to
        strengthen the awareness of privacy security risks. For example, when you access third-party
        websites, links, products or services from our services, for the security of any data
        collected by those websites, links, products or services, please read through the terms and
        conditions of those third-parties carefully. We do not take any legal responsibility for
        data security issues caused by such third parties. If you find that certain contents,
        advertisements or features in our websites, products or services may be provided by a third
        party and may possibly endanger your privacy and security, please contact us promptly, as we
        will handle it with priority in accordance with laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>IV. How We Share, Transfer and Disclose Your Personal Information and Data</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When sharing, transferring, and disclosing your personal information, we uphold the
        principles and requirements of minimization, necessity, and legality. Under normal
        circumstances, we do not share, transfer or disclose your personal information externally.
        However, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we may share, transfer
        and disclose your personal information in the following situations:
      </p>
      <p>1. How we share your personal information</p>
      <p>
        We do not sell any personal information to third parties. In order to provide you with
        timely services, your personal information may be shared with our affiliated companies. We
        will only share your information within our affiliated companies for legitimate and explicit
        purposes, and only share the information necessary to provide the services, and are bound by
        the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. If a purpose concerned is not included in this
        Policy, we will state it in the corresponding privacy policy or notice of the specific
        product or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share the necessary personal information with authorized third-party partners
        (including technical service providers, data storage service providers, after-sales service
        providers, marketing promotion service providers, third-party SDK service providers, etc.)
        for the performance of certain features or to provide you with better service and a better
        user experience. For example, in order to enable you to share information to third party
        platforms, use location service and other kinds of services and features, we may embed third
        party SDK or other similar applications of authorized partners in this Application. We
        uphold the principles of minimization, necessity, and legality to carry out such sharing.
        Before sharing information, we will sign strict confidentiality agreements with authorized
        partners and require them to take relevant confidentiality and security measures to process
        personal information in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws in your
        jurisdiction. In addition, we will also require them to provide data security capabilities
        and information security qualifications (e.g., grade protection assessment, information
        security management system). When we embed the third party SDK or other similar applications
        of authorized partners in this Application, we will notify you promptly and request the SDK
        service provider that obtains the information to protect your data security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to provide evaluation, analysis or other business services, we may also share your
        non-personal information with third parties. For example, we may use aggregated data to help
        partners (e.g., advertising service providers) understand the effectiveness, feedback and
        usage trends of their services.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, asset transfer and other
        related transaction, if a personal information transfer is involved, we will require the new
        entity or organization holding your personal information to continue to be bound by this
        Policy through an agreement or other appropriate measures, and we will require such subject
        to take confidentiality and security measures of a degree no less than the requirements of
        this Policy to process personal information.
      </p>
      <p>2. How we transfer your personal information</p>
      <p>
        Simple Cleaner will not transfer your information to any other parties, except in the
        following circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>(1) Obtain your explicit consent.</p>
      <p>
        (2) If Simple Cleaner is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or part of its
        assets, which may affect your personal information, we will issue a prominent notice via
        email and/or on our website or other appropriate methods to inform you of any changes in the
        ownership and your rights of your personal information, and any choices you may have about
        your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) In the case that has been explained in this privacy policy or notified you by other
        means.
      </p>
      <p>3. How we disclose your personal information</p>
      <p>
        According to the legal requirements, legal procedures, litigation and/or requests from
        government departments and authorities, Simple Cleaner may need to disclose your personal
        information. If the disclosure is necessary or appropriate for national security, law
        enforcement, or other matters of public importance, we may also disclose information about
        you.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, we may share your personal information with:</p>
      <p>
        (1) Our attorneys, lawyers, accountants, auditors, or similar consultants, when we request
        them to provide professional advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Investors and other relevant third parties, if actual or potential sales or other
        company transactions occur and are related to entities within our group.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Other third parties, for example, the disclosure of specific information with your
        authorization.
      </p>
      <p><strong>V. How Your Personal Information is Transferred Across Borders</strong></p>
      <p>
        For the purposes described in this Policy, and to the extent permitted by applicable local
        laws and regulations and with your authorized consent, we may transfer your personal
        information to the resources or servers stipulated in section III of this Policy for storage
        or processing, we may also transfer your personal information to third-party service
        providers and business partners and your data may therefore also be transmitted to other
        countries or regions. The privacy protection laws of these countries or regions may be
        different, and the jurisdiction in which these global resources or servers are located may
        or may not protect personal information to the same standards as in your jurisdiction.
        However, we will still strive to comply with our Privacy Policy to protect your personal
        information, and we will follow the legal requirements of the country or region where the
        personal information is located to carry out the corresponding cross-border transfer and
        other processing of personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the circumstance that we transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction,
        whether it transferred to our affiliates or third-party service providers, we will comply
        with relevant applicable laws. We will take appropriate security measures and safeguards to
        make sure that all such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection
        laws.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>VI. Your Rights to Your Personal Information</strong></p>
      <p>
        As a data subject, you have a series of rights to your personal information, including the
        right to confirm, access, correct, delete, withdraw consent, and lodge complaints
        (hereinafter referred to as "request"). We fully understand and respect your rights, and
        such rights will be subject to specific exclusions and exceptions under applicable laws. We
        will also take active steps to ensure that your rights are effectively protected. However,
        please understand and note that for security reasons, we may need to verify your identity
        before processing your request. In principle, we do not charge a fee for your lawful and
        reasonable request, but we will charge a certain reasonable fee for repeated requests that
        exceed the reasonable limit where applicable, and based on actual administrative costs
        permitted by the applicable laws. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive,
        require excessive technical means (for example, to develop new systems or fundamentally
        change existing practices), pose risks to the legal rights of others or are extremely
        impractical, or violate the mandatory provisions by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1 Right to confirm and access</strong>: We inform you how we collect and process
        personal information through this Policy or in the form of a privacy policy or notice of the
        specific product or service. You have the right to confirm or reject such collection and
        processing via a check box or other methods. However, after you reject, some features that
        require your explicit authorization and consent to use may no longer be available. You can
        directly access the personal information you have provided to us in the interface of our
        products or services. For those that you are unable to access, you can send an email
        to jinhaoye080@gmail.com. We will handle it promptly after receiving your email.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>6.2 Right to correct and delete</strong>: When your personal information is
        changed, or when you find that your personal information collected and processed by us is
        inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to make corrections or additions. You
        can directly correct or modify some of your personal information on the relevant
        product/service function pages. When your personal information collected by us has fulfilled
        the purpose of collection or is no longer required, or when you find that our collection and
        processing of your personal information violates the provisions of laws and regulations or
        this Privacy Policy, you have the right to ask us to delete the relevant personal
        information. For personal information that we have not provided you with a channel for

      </p>
      <p>
        However, we may not grant your deleting request in some situations, for example, if you ask
        us to delete your transaction data when we are legally obligated to keep a record of that
        transaction to comply with the applicable local law. Please also kindly note that if you
        request to delete your information from our products and services, we may not remove the
        corresponding information from the backup system immediately due to some applicable local
        laws and technological limitations, however, we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until the backup is updating or can
        be deleted or be made anonymous. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.3 Right to withdraw consent</strong>: To achieve the respective features of our
        various products or services, we will require necessary personal information in accordance
        with the applicable local laws. This is described in the "How We Collect and Use Your

        to us for a specific purpose by deleting information, turning off device features, and
        requesting to withdraw consent, including the collection, use and/or disclosure of your

        reasonable time after you send the request, and thereafter will not collect, use and/or
        disclose your personal information in accordance with your request.

        benefit of Simple Cleaner and its Service. The withdrawal of your consent or authorization
        will not affect the validity of our previous processing activities based on your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>6.4 Right to complain: </strong>You have the right to lodge a complaint by sending
        us an email at jinhaoye080@gmail.com. We will respond promptly after receiving your

        personal information violates your legitimate rights and interests, you may refer your
        complaint or report to your local statutory personal data protection department, or file a
        lawsuit with a competent court.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>6.5 Right to control your privacy settings</strong></p>
      <p>
        You have the right to control your privacy settings and restrict our collection, use,
        disclosure, or processing of your personal information via such privacy settings. For
        example, you can choose to turn off the permissions of "Automatic Updates" to stop the junk

        information related to the child under guardianship, please contact us by methods as
        described herein, and we will respond in a timely manner. If you find that a child’s
        information has been collected to us without the awareness of the legal guardian, please
        send an email to jinhaoye080@gmail.com to contact us. We will remove the relevant
        information as soon as possible. If we find that we have collected the personal information

        relevant content as soon as possible.
      </p>

        products and services provided by any third party. Since we are not able to substantially
